# 🔐 AWS IAM: Users, Groups, and Roles

## 🎉 Introduction
AWS **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** allows secure management of **who can access AWS resources** and what actions they can perform.

Understanding **Users, Groups, and Roles** is essential for maintaining security and access control within AWS environments.

## 📌 1️⃣ IAM Users
### 🔹 What is an IAM User?
An **IAM user** represents **an individual person or application** that interacts with AWS.

### 🔹 Key Features
✅ Has a **unique name** within an AWS account.  
✅ Can have **login credentials** (password for AWS Console, access keys for CLI/API).  
✅ Can be assigned **permissions** using IAM policies.  

### 🏆 **Use Case**
A developer needs access to **deploy applications on AWS**. An IAM user is created with permissions to use **EC2, S3, and Lambda**.

📌 **Best Practice:**  
- Avoid using the **root user** for daily tasks.  
- Create **separate IAM users** for each individual.

## 📌 2️⃣ IAM Groups
### 🔹 What is an IAM Group?
An **IAM group** is a collection of **IAM users** that share **common permissions**.

### 🔹 Key Features
✅ **Simplifies access management** – Apply policies to a group instead of individual users.  
✅ Users **inherit permissions** from the group.  
✅ A user **can belong to multiple groups**.  

### 🏆 **Use Case**
- A company has a **Developers group** with permissions to **read/write S3 and launch EC2 instances**.
- A **Finance group** has access only to **AWS Billing and Cost Explorer**.

📌 **Best Practice:**  
- Assign permissions to **groups instead of individual users**.  
- Use groups to **logically organize users** (e.g., Admins, Developers, Auditors).

## 📌 3️⃣ IAM Roles
### 🔹 What is an IAM Role?
An **IAM Role** is an **identity with specific permissions** that can be **assumed temporarily** by users, AWS services, or external accounts.

### 🔹 Key Features
✅ **Does not require login credentials** (passwords or access keys).  
✅ Provides **temporary access** to AWS resources.  
✅ Can be used by **EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and external AWS accounts**.  

### 🏆 **Use Case**
1️⃣ **EC2 Instance Role:** An EC2 instance assumes a role to access **S3 without hardcoding credentials**.  
2️⃣ **Cross-Account Access:** A user in **Account A** assumes a role in **Account B** to manage resources.  
3️⃣ **AWS Service Role:** AWS Lambda assumes a role to read data from **DynamoDB**.  

📌 **Best Practice:**  
- Use **IAM Roles instead of access keys** for AWS services.  
- Implement **role-based access control** (RBAC) to minimize unnecessary permissions.  
- Apply the **Principle of Least Privilege** (only grant necessary permissions).

## 📌 4️⃣ Differences Between Users, Groups, and Roles
| Feature | IAM Users | IAM Groups | IAM Roles |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Purpose | Represents **an individual** | Groups multiple users | Provides **temporary access** |
| Credentials | Uses **passwords & access keys** | Users inherit credentials | No credentials (assumed temporarily) |
| Assigned Policies | Directly attached | Attached at the group level | Temporary permissions assigned |
| Best For | Individual user access | Managing multiple users easily | Secure service-to-service access |

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
✅ **IAM Users** – Individual identities that interact with AWS.  
✅ **IAM Groups** – Collections of users sharing common permissions.  
✅ **IAM Roles** – Provide temporary access to AWS services & external users.
