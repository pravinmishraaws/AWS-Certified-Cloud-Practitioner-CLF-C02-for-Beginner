### **6. What is an S3 bucket lifecycle policy?**
<details style="font-size: 14px; cursor: pointer; outline: none;">
  <summary>See the Answer</summary>
  An **S3 lifecycle policy** is a set of rules that **automate data management** within an Amazon S3 bucket by transitioning or deleting objects based on defined criteria. It allows:
  - **Moving objects between storage classes** (e.g., S3 Standard ‚Üí S3 Glacier for cost savings).
  - **Deleting objects automatically** after a certain period to free up storage.
  - **Defining lifecycle rules** for versioning, expiration, and cleanup of incomplete multipart uploads.

  Example policy:
  ```json
  {
    "Rules": [
      {
        "ID": "MoveToGlacier",
        "Status": "Enabled",
        "Prefix": "logs/",
        "Transitions": [
          {
            "Days": 30,
            "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
          }
        ],
        "Expiration": {
          "Days": 365
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
