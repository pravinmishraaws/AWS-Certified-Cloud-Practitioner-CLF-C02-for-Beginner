# ☁️ Understanding Cloud Computing

## 🎉 Welcome Back!

In this section, you will gain a clear understanding of **Cloud Computing** through two key lessons:

1️⃣ **What is Cloud Computing?** – Learn the definition and core principles of cloud computing.
2️⃣ **Cloud Computing Core Services** – Understand the fundamental services, including Compute, Storage, Networking, and Database.

## 📝 Study Notes
To help with revision, **study notes** have been created. You can download or print them, but these should not replace your **handwritten notes**. 

### ✍️ Why Should You Take Your Own Notes?
Taking personal notes is crucial for learning and retention. Here’s why:

### **1️⃣ Active Engagement**
- Writing **forces active engagement** with the material.
- Instead of passively reading or listening, you **process the concepts** and organize thoughts in your own words.
- This enhances understanding and solidifies knowledge.

### **2️⃣ Better Retention**
- Writing **helps transfer information** from short-term to long-term memory.
- The physical act of writing creates **muscle memory**, strengthening recall ability.
- This is known as the **generative effect**, where generating information (writing) improves memory retention more than just consuming it.

### **3️⃣ Clarifying Ideas**
- Writing forces you to **simplify concepts** and put them in your own words.
- It helps **identify knowledge gaps** and clarify confusing points, improving overall understanding.

### **4️⃣ Repetition & Adaptation**
- Writing takes time, and during the process, you **revisit concepts multiple times**.
- Exposure to the material multiple times improves recall in the long term.

## 📖 Real-Life Example
Recently, I **passed the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialist Certification in just 12 days**. I followed this strategy:
- **Daily note-taking.**
- **Reviewing notes every evening.**
- **Rewriting and summarizing concepts.**

This repeated exposure to concepts helped me reinforce my learning. **Remember your school days?** Teachers always encouraged rewriting concepts and reading them aloud—because it works! 

## 🎯 Quizzes
After reviewing the study notes, you’ll find **quizzes** to test your knowledge.
- If you're confused by any question, **review your notes**.
- If doubts persist, **revisit the study materials or watch my videos**.
- Only move forward **once you feel 100% confident**.
